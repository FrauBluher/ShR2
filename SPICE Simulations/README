This folder contains a spice simulation of a signal conditioning
circuit which will pass transients at .001V 120dB higher than the
60Hz carrier (attenuated by -90dB).  An anti-aliasing
filter will need to be added as well as a few other trivial components
whose requirements will be dictated by the desired sample rate.
