This folder contains a spice simulation of a signal conditioning
circuit which will pass transients at .001V 20dB higher than the
60Hz carrier (attenuated by -60dB).  This circuit also accuarately
models the nonlinearity of the isolation transformer which can be
found in the datasheets folder. (Newavatech S22230)  An anti-aliasing
filter will need to be added as well as a few other trivial components
whose requirements will be dictated by the desired sample rate.
