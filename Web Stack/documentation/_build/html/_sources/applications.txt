Applications
============

Four distinct applications were created that encompass the SEAD web framework:

1. Microdata - Interfaces with the devices
2. Webapp - Interfaces with the clients
3. Farmer - Manages the devices
4. Home - Landing zone for new users

And (optionally) a fifth:

5. Debug - Models that assist in debugging the project

The applications were designed such that the Webapp application is hot-swappable. Since it is a proof of concept, it can either be added to or replaced altogether. Microdata and Farmer are able to run without Webapp, however their data cannot be interfaced with in a meaningful way without a web application.
