 * @brief 	This library provides methods to init and read the ADS85x8.
 *
 * This module provides definitions and methods for setting configuration bits on
 * the ADS85x8 series ADCs.  Support for serial communications mode is not intended
 * as of this version of the library, i.e. the target is for a parallel configuration.

/**
 * @brief CONFIGURATION_REGISTER data bit positions.
 *
 * Note that REFDAC is only active in software mode and correspond to the setting
 * of the internal reference DAC, the value ranges from 0x00CC (.5v) to 0x03FF (2.5v)
 * in 2.44mV/LSB or to 0x03FF (3.0v) in 2.92/LSB if bit 13 is high.
 *
 * In hardware mode, when pin 34 is pulled down to ground the input voltage range
 * is set to +/- 4VREF which can be adjusted by REFDAC in the configuration register.
 * In software mode VREF is either 2.5 or 3V, set by bit 13 in the configuration
 * register.
 *
 * When "This bit is (not) active in hardware mode." is stated in the configuration bit
 * description below it means that the bit is either high or low when the ADC is set
 * to be used in the HW configuration.  Configuration bits can only be written in SW
 * mode.
